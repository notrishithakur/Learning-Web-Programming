# Learning-Web-Programming
The plan is to document my journey while I learn Web Programming and write about it.

For How ?

Due to some work and final semester burden, I stopped updating this repo but I've finally assigned some time to again get back into the action of learning. This time, I'll be creating something too along with it and that's why I'm much more excited moving forward.

If you know me, you know how much I love gaming. But Being honest I was never that much good to participate in any gaming tournament and exit with flying colours. I always was kind of jealous of the owners of the team as they were the one who went home with the biggest chunk of the winnning amount. I wanted to be one and this project will be just a glimpse of what I'm aimimg for.
